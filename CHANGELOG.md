# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Non-git directory support — `tfrev review` now scans local `.tf`/`.tfvars` files when not in a git repository
- Default branch auto-detection — detects `main` vs `master` instead of hardcoding `main`
- Resource-aware context discovery — uses plan resource addresses and module references to find relevant `.tf` files, not just root-level globs
- Local module source resolution — follows relative `source` paths in module blocks to include module source files as context
- `PermissionDeniedError` handling with actionable error message for insufficient API key permissions

### Changed
- Removed per-model context limit mapping — uses a single default context limit (200k tokens) that works with any model
- Context window overflow now prompts the user to continue instead of hard-failing (default: abort)
- Missing `--base-ref` now warns the user with an explanation of what it is and the fallback behavior, then asks to confirm before proceeding
- Both-refs-fail scenario now falls back to empty-tree diff instead of exiting with an error
- Development status classifier changed from `Production/Stable` to `Beta`
- README sample output updated to use real AWS resource types instead of `null_resource`
- README cost section clarified with typical cost range and single-call model
- ARCHITECTURE.md corrected to accurately describe single-call model (no chunking)

### Removed
- `--plan-text` option — use `--plan` with JSON output from `terraform show -json` instead
- `httpx` direct dependency — now uses `anthropic.Timeout` from the Anthropic SDK

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-04

### Changed
- Made documentation and examples cloud-agnostic (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes)
- Updated system prompt security analysis to cover multi-cloud providers
- Expanded `.tfrev.yaml.example` with GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes sensitive resources

### Removed
- Unused `changes.diff` example file

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- CLI with `review` command (`--plan`, `--plan-text`, `--auto`, `--base-ref`)
- Auto-generated git diff — tfrev runs `git diff` internally, no manual diff file needed
- `--base-ref` flag to control what git ref the diff is generated against
- Empty-tree fallback — when no changes exist vs base ref (e.g. first commit), reviews all current `.tf` files
- Base ref auto-detection from CI env vars (`GITHUB_BASE_REF`, `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME`, `CHANGE_TARGET`)
- JSON, Markdown, and Table output formats
- `.tfrev.yaml` configuration with custom policies and sensitive resource lists
- `config.ignore` filtering — diff files matching ignore patterns are excluded
- Terraform source file context discovery for surrounding `.tf` files
- GitHub Action, GitLab CI template, Jenkins pipeline integrations
- Claude API client with exponential backoff retries on rate limit and server errors
- API timeout (120s request, 10s connect)
- Context window overflow detection with automatic context file trimming
- Progress spinner during API calls
- Token estimation accuracy logging
- Test suite with pytest (168 tests, 92% coverage)
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (pytest, ruff, mypy across Python 3.9-3.13)
- PyPI publish workflow via trusted publishing (triggered on `v*` tags)
- `py.typed` marker for PEP 561 type checking support
- Docker support
